1. Download json files from Neo4J: make sure to select a sufficient number of returned items
2. paste the json files into the folder `~/data/`: nodes as `nodes.json` and paths as `paths.json`
3. create folder `~/results/` if it does not exist in the source folder
4. run command "node convert.js" (node.js must be installed)
